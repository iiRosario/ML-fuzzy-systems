# Fuzzy Systems in MATLAB

This GitHub repository contains MATLAB code for the implementation and analysis of fuzzy systems. The project is divided into two main parts: Part A focuses on constructing controllers with 9, 25, and 49 rules, emphasizing the crucial design steps from initial rule selection to parameter tuning. Part B delves into the application of Neuro-Fuzzy systems for modeling dynamic systems, incorporating temporal dependencies through clustering techniques.

## Part A: Fuzzy Controllers

### Overview
In this section of the report, we outline the process of constructing controllers with 9, 25, and 49 rules. We highlight key design stages, ranging from the initial rule selection to parameter tuning, providing a comprehensive view of our construction method. Additionally, we present the obtained results, evaluating each controller based on specific metrics. Performance assessments are conducted in both perturbed and unperturbed scenarios, offering an in-depth understanding of the impact of varying rule quantities on the overall system effectiveness.

### Contents
1. **Construction Process**
   - Initial rule selection
   - Design stages
   - Parameter tuning

2. **Results Analysis**
   - Performance metrics
   - Evaluation in perturbed and unperturbed scenarios

3. **Comprehensive Results Analysis**

## Part B: Neuro-Fuzzy Systems for Dynamic Modeling

### Overview
The second part of this project focuses on the application of Neuro-Fuzzy systems for modeling dynamic systems. These systems often depend not only on present inputs but also on past inputs and outputs. Through the utilization of clustering techniques, we aim to obtain rules that capture the temporal dependencies inherent in dynamic systems.
